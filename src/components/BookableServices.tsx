 *
 * Placement is explicit per tile rather than relying on source order, because
 * the tall tile has to sit beside two short ones -- auto-flow would leave a
 * hole under it.
 *
 * Clicking a tile opens what that service includes; it does NOT jump to the
 * booking form. Tile size is the loudest signal on this section, so the visitor
 * gets to read before being asked for their phone number, and the Book button
 * lives inside the panel once they have.
 *
 * Below `lg` the whole thing becomes one column. A two-column bento with row
 * spans cannot survive a 390px screen, and the size hierarchy simply does not
 * exist there -- order is the only signal left, so the tiles keep their order.
