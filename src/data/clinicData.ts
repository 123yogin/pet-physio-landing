  // name about invented patients, describing clinical outcomes on a real
  // veterinary practice's homepage. They arrived with the same site template
  // that supplied three fabricated clinicians (see SPECIALISTS above).
  //
  // They were display-only rather than emitted as Review/AggregateRating
  // schema, which is the one thing that kept this out of Google's structured
  // data. seo/schema.ts deliberately emits neither, and it must stay that way

  //
  // The clinic HAS real reviews — 24 of them on its Google Business Profile —
  // and those are what belongs here. They could not be pulled automatically:
  // the profile is not indexed by the available search tools, and reading
  // review text needs the Google Places API plus the clinic's place_id.
  // Writing stand-ins in the meantime would have recreated the exact defect
  // this removal exists to fix, so the section renders nothing instead.
  //
  // To restore: paste each real review as one entry. `quote` and `ownerName`
  // come straight from the review; `petName`, `breed`, `condition` and
  // `storyDetails` only if the reviewer actually stated them — leave them out
  // rather than filling the shape.
