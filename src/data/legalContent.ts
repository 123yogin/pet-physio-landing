/**
 * Privacy and terms copy.
 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE EDITING.
 *
 * Everything stated as fact here was verified against the code, not assumed:
 *
 *  - the field list is `EnquiryCreateSerializer` in the clinic API, which is
 *    what the booking form actually posts;
 *  - "no cookies" was measured in the browser -- document.cookie, localStorage
 *    and sessionStorage are all empty on every route, which is also why this
 *    site has no cookie banner;
 *  - the third-party hosts are the ones the page really contacts
 *    (fonts.googleapis.com, fonts.gstatic.com, lh3.googleusercontent.com).
 *    The image host is listed again because the condition illustrations were
 *    restored to the originals, which are served from it. This line tracks
 *    what the site actually loads -- if those images become local again, it
 *    has to come back out.
 *
 * If any of that changes -- an analytics script, a chat widget, a new form
 * field -- this file is now wrong and has to change with it.
 *
 * Contact details ARE now real (email and phone, supplied 2026-09-19) and are
 * written into the rights section.
 *
 * What is still deliberately NOT written here: retention periods, the grievance
 * officer's NAME, and governing law. Those are commitments a business makes,
 * not facts a developer can read off the source, and under India's DPDP Act
 * naming a grievance officer is a legal requirement rather than a nicety.
 * They are marked NEEDS_CLINIC and render as a visible callout so they cannot
 * ship unnoticed.
