/**
 * The things a visitor can actually book, and what each one includes.
 *
 * This is a different list from SERVICES in clinicData.ts, and the difference
 * matters. SERVICES describes the clinic's *therapy menu* -- manual work,
 * electro-physical equipment, and so on -- which is what a clinician does.
 * This is what a pet owner asks for. "Grooming" and "Walking" are not
 * therapies at all, and "Physiotherapy" as a booking covers several of the
 * therapies listed over there.
 *
 * Every `code` is an Appointment.VISIT_TYPES value, so pressing Book on a card
 * selects that exact service in the form and the clinic receives a code its own
 * booking screen already understands. Codes are checked against the live
 * /appointment-options response at render time rather than trusted: a card for
 * a service the clinic has retired should disappear, not post a value the API
 * would reject.
 *
 * The inclusions are the clinic's own words from its service notes. Nothing
 * clinical is invented here -- where the notes say only "Physiotherapy", this
 * lists the therapies from the same notes rather than describing what they
 * achieve.
