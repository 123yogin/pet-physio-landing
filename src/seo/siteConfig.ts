/**
 * SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for every business fact used by the SEO layer.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * STATUS (2026-09-19): the NAP is REAL. Name, address, phone, email, the map
 * listing and the Instagram profile were supplied by the clinic and are live.
 *
 * What is still NOT settled, and must not be invented:
 *   - which DAYS the 9:30–13:30 window applies to (see `openingHours`)
 *   - any out-of-hours / emergency number (see `contact.emergencyName`)
 *   - `verification` tokens, and `foundingYear` (still 0)
 *
 * Nothing in the SEO layer hardcodes any of this — titles, descriptions,
 * canonicals, Open Graph tags, JSON-LD, robots.txt, sitemap.xml and llms.txt are
 * all DERIVED from this file plus `src/data/clinicData.ts`.
 *
 * To go live with real data you edit ONLY two places:
 *   1. this file (business identity / NAP / hours / geo / socials / origin)
 *   2. src/data/clinicData.ts (conditions, services, specialists, FAQs, …)
 *
 * Then run `npm run build`. Every route, tag, schema block and sitemap entry
 * regenerates automatically. See SEO.md.
 *
 * Anything still unswapped is tagged `@placeholder`, so `npm run seo:check` can
 * find it before you deploy.
